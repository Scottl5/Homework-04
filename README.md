# Homework-04
This is the homework for week four. It required us to make a quiz website. I created basic HTML and CSS as I wanted to focus more on the Javascript of the website. In the HTML, I created four buttons for the answers, and a start button. I also created a header and a paragraph describing the quiz. Within the CSS, I hid the four answer buttons using the display none. In the Javascript, I created a function that was called when the start button was clicked. Once that button was clicked, I removed the hidden property of the answer buttons so they would appear. I also created a timer that appears when the start button was clicked. Once a user answered the question it would move on to the next one. If they got it wrong, it would deduct five seconds off of the timer. This website is still in a work in progress as I need some help with this, so future submissions are planned.
